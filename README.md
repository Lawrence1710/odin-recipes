# Odin Recipes

This is a basic HTML project built as part of The Odin Project curriculum.

It includes a homepage and three individual recipe pages:

- Fried Chicken
- Spaghetti Bolognese
- Greek Salad

Each recipe page contains:

- An image of the dish
- A short description
- A list of ingredients
- Step-by-step cooking instructions

## Future Plans

- Add CSS for better styling and layout
- Make the site mobile-friendly
